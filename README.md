# Minimalist Connect 4
I decided I wanted to make connect 4, so I did. It's not finished yet, but it looks nice.
[Try it out!](https://jmang00.github.io/minimalist-connect-4/)

## To do
- ~~Add game over logic~~
- ~~Add a few text instructions (yellow's turn, game over, red wins etc)~~
- 'It's a draw' when there are no spaces left
- Fix a bug where the token stays hanging
- Make a bot to play against
- Add a header
- Add a reset/play again button
